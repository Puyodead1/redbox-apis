<h1 align="center">Redbox API's | Powered by Express.js</h1>

<p align="center">A feature-rich API designed to restore the functionality of your Redbox kiosk, as well as Redbox Perks.<br>An attempt to recreate the Redbox backend APIs.<br></p>

#### This project has been merged with the now unmaintained [RedboxAPI](https://github.com/BrianWalczak/RedboxAPI) project, restoring functionality for the Redbox Perks loyalty program.

## Installation
To get started with hosting your Redbox API instance, make sure you have Node.js and pnpm installed. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. **Install Node.js** from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Puyodead1/redbox-apis.git
cd redbox-apis
pnpm install
```

Next, you'll need to configure a few environment variables (`.env`).
```bash
DATABASE_PATH="./database" # Path to the database folder (transactions, users, and credentials)
BASE_DOMAIN="example.com" # Replace this with your hosted web-server domain (optional, used for signup emails)

# These details are required to send and receive Redbox receipts, and signup information.
SMTP_HOSTNAME="mail.example.com"
SMTP_PORT=465

SMTP_USERNAME="email@example.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD="password"


# -- Loyalty Configuration (optional) -- #

# Points per $1.00 spent based on tier (for used disc purchases)
EARNING_MEMBER=50
EARNING_STAR=50
EARNING_SUPERSTAR=75
EARNING_LEGEND=100

# Amount of points earned per night (rentals)
RENTAL_POINTS_PER_NIGHT=150

# Redemption amount needed for 1 free night rental
RENTAL_REDEMPTION_GOAL=2000

# Signup bonus granted to new members (currently 1 free night)
NEW_POINT_BALANCE=2000

# Default tier the user is signed up for.
# Accepted Options: Member, Star, Superstar, Legend
NEW_TIER_DEFAULT="Member"

# Amount of purchases needed for each tier level-up
TIER_MEMBER_PURCHASES=0 # No minimum requirement
TIER_STAR_PURCHASES=10 # 10+ purchases minimum
TIER_SUPERSTAR_PURCHASES=20 # 20+ purchases minimum
TIER_LEGEND_PURCHASES=50 # 50+ purchases minimum
```

Additionally, you'll need to configure your Redbox Perks web server before starting it. During this step, make a few configurations in your environment variables (`./packages/redbox-perks/.env`):
```bash
USE_RECAPTCHA="false" # Use reCAPTCHA on your website (not required)
RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY="" # Replace with reCAPTCHA public key (optional, leave blank if disabled)
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY="" # Replace with reCAPTCHA secret key (optional, leave blank if disabled)
SERVER_PORT="3000" # Port the Redbox Perks website will be live on
SESSION_TOKEN="A4c9JkT8vG2YyLw5gPsQz9fA1uKJm7eT6wExRzC9jX4sZbF2mT" # Used for express sessions (case-sensitive)
RATE_LIMITING="false" # Used to prevent spam requests, you may need to configure the web server manually to trust proxies if using nginx, apache, etc.


# -- Loyalty Configuration (optional) -- #

# Signup bonus granted to new members (currently 1 free night)
NEW_POINT_BALANCE=2000

# Default tier the user is signed up for.
# Accepted Options: Member, Star, Superstar, Legend
NEW_TIER_DEFAULT="Member"

# Password to access the admin panel (case-sensitive)
ADMIN_PASSWORD="iJikLosGYs6s&8Lo#P#Lb7s^sS8xoQDDPdMBfcKwnLJPiRj9D^R3^oAQ8aK*XDGi"
```
*(throughout this project, you'll find example configurations at `.env.example`. please copy this file and rename to `.env` if you haven't configured your server yet)*

> ##### If you'd like to use reCAPTCHA (completely optional), you'll need to create a new project by visiting your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Then, visit the **APIs & Services** page and enable the [reCAPTCHA Enterprise API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com) (you may need to search for it). After enabling the API for your Google Cloud project, access the reCAPTCHA dashboard [here](https://www.google.com/u/1/recaptcha/admin/create) and follow the steps to add your domain (the one you'll use for the dashboard) and get your reCAPTCHA keys.

If you're okay with the default configuration, you can close the file. Once you've configured your web server, you're all done!

## Building

Before you start the Redbox API, it's important to follow these steps to make sure your kiosk is configured properly:

Begin by opening the File Explorer on your Redbox kiosk and clearing the folder at `C:\ProgramData\Redbox\KioskClient\HttpQueue` to empty the queue of old HTTP requests (preventing any old transactions from being processed).

Make sure Standalone mode on your Redbox kiosk is **disabled**. You can find this registry key at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:\SOFTWARE\Redbox\REDS\KioskEngine\Store`.

Once these steps are complete and your API server is configured, use the following commands to finish building the project:
```
pnpm build # compiles the project
pnpm migrate:prod # run this only on the first start
pnpm start # start the API server
```

## Usage
To apply these changes to your Redbox kiosk (and update the API to your custom server), youâ€™ll need to configure the kiosk.
1. In the File Explorer, navigate to the file `C:\ProgramData\Redbox\UpdateClient\IoT\iotcertificatedata.json` and delete it.
2. Open the file `C:\ProgramData\Redbox\configuration\configuration.json` in a text editor, and update **every** URL present to point to your Redbox API server (either a custom domain or your router's IP address if you're using port forwarding).

During the following steps, use the ports found below. Finally, restart your Redbox kiosk to apply the changes. Your kiosk will now be connected to your custom API!
-   Proxy Serivce: 3012
-   Data Service: 3013
-   Ad Server: 3014
-   Transaction Service: 3015
-   Reels: 3016
-   Kiosk Inventory: 3017
-   IOT Certificate Service: 3018

## Development
-   If you modify something in `db` or `common`, you can rebuild those quicker with the following command: `pnpm prebuild`
-   To run a script on a specific package, use the following operation: `pnpm --filter <package name> run <script name> [any args]`

### Scripts
Listed are the workspace scripts, individual packages may specify their own additional scripts

-   `build` - Builds all packages
-   `start` - Starts all servers
-   `clean` - Cleans `server.log` and the `dist` folder of every package
-   `prebuild` - Builds `common` and `db` packages
-   `migrate:prod` - Run migrations for a production database
-   `migrate:dev` - Run migrations for a development database
-   `seed` - Seed the database, mainly for development, currently is just for adding promo codes for testing

## Files
Within this project, you'll find the following file in the `database/` folder:
- **users.json**: This file stores user accounts for the Redbox Perks loyalty system. By default, user PIN/passwords are hashed and salted (thanks to [**bcrypt.js**](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js)) for extra security.

*(within this folder, you'll find example files for these named `______.example.json`. to create this required files, copy them and rename to the appropriate name)*
